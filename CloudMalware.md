# Cloud Malware Specialist
**I am greatly interested in cloud security, but recently I have found a fascination with malware reverse engineering.**
- I thought that I could combine my interests into a niche group called a Cloud Malware Specialist.
- I imagine it would create value in a rapidly growing market. I noticed that entry level is flooded with saturation amongst applicants whom have little to no experience or effort tailored to the role. I am not far from the group, but I am trying extensively to create a gap between myself and them, though not with ease.
- I think by specializing, the importance of my role will out perform 99% of generalized applicants, my current self included.
