##  Take-Two EULA and Privacy Policy | Consumer Privacy Violations
As a cybersecurity professional, I‚Äôm warning fellow users about invasive, anti-consumer changes to the Take-Two EULA and Privacy Policy.

I have left verified, compliant protest reviews on the following titles:

- [x] Red Dead Redemption 2
- [x] Grand Theft Auto V
- [x] Grand Theft Auto IV
- [x] Borderlands 2
- [x] Borderlands: The Presequel
- [x] Bioshock Infinite
- [x] Bioshock
- [x] Civilization VI

Key issues:
- Modding bans
- VM usage ban
- Profiling and behavioral surveillance
- Data resale to ad networks
- Content ownership transfer
- Arbitration clause stripping legal rights

If you‚Äôre a player, a modder, or a developer ‚Äî **this matters**. Speak up now or lose the right to play freely.

## Details
Based on a full review of the Take-Two EULA and Privacy Policy, this system very closely resembles commercial-grade spyware, particularly by modern threat modeling and privacy ethics standards.

Here's a breakdown using spyware criteria and consumer hostility analysis:

Spyware Criteria Evaluation:

Surreptitious system monitoring
  
- ‚úÖ Collects IP, device info, software details, app installs, OS version, and browsing behavior without explicit informed consent at install time.

Behavioral profiling
  
- ‚úÖ Builds dynamic consumer profiles via usage data and ad network signals.

Keystroke/content monitoring
  
- ‚úÖ Borderline Chat logs, audio recordings, in-game interactions, and custom content are captured and stored. While not full keylogging, this is still highly invasive.

Audio/visual recording
- ‚úÖ Explicitly logs voice chat, gameplay footage, avatars, and video footage in testing environments.

Data exfiltration to 3rd parties
- ‚úÖ Shares personal identifiers, usage history, and inferences with advertising networks. Data is also disclosed to vendors and affiliates.

Anti-privacy engineering
- ‚úÖ Bans virtual machines and remote sessions to block obfuscation, sandboxing, or isolation ‚Äî an anti-user move commonly seen in DRM spyware.

Evasive language / vague consent
- ‚úÖ Consent is buried in clickwrap agreements. Changes to data policy are implemented with ‚Äúnotice‚Äù and assumed agreement through continued use.

Verdict: Yes, it exhibits spyware-like behavior, by modern infosec and data ethics standards. It lacks rootkit-level code injection, but the scope and intent mirror enterprise surveillance tools.

üíÄ Consumer Hostility Scorecard

- Modding ban
Explicit and strict; no fair-use carveouts Kills community creativity and player control

- VM ban
Enforced via TOS; blocks privacy-focused setups Blocks advanced users from isolating the game

- Surveillance
Extensive, tied to gameplay and device activity Personal data and behavioral analytics monetized

- Data resale
Opt-out only; ad partners included Player behavior is a product

- Arbitration clause
Mandatory with 30-day opt-out via postal mail Waives class action and jury trial rights

- Ownership model
All UGC and custom content is theirs You build, they own

- Public exposure
Leaderboards, forums, and chat are not private Players may unknowingly expose private info

- Consent enforcement
Continued use = consent Consent is passive and legally insulated

Hostility Grade: A (Aggressive Monetization, Rights Stripping, Surveillance-Heavy)
This isn't designed for player empowerment ‚Äî it's designed to extract value, limit control, and shield the company from legal recourse.
